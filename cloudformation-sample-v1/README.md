This README.md file provides an overview of the CloudFormation template created for the project. The template includes resources for an API Gateway, Lambda functions, SQS Queue, DynamoDB Table, RDS Database, and an S3 Bucket. These resources are configured to implement a scenario where an API Gateway triggers a Lambda function, which sends data to an SQS Queue. The SQS Queue then triggers another Lambda function that sends data to both DynamoDB and RDS. Finally, the data is stored in an S3 Bucket and sent back to the API Gateway.
